There are two main directories for potential use in here, 17-lists and 18-lists.  
The 17-lists directory is based on a bed file with regions containing confidently identified variants, the source list can be downloaded here: ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/release/NA12878_HG001/latest/GRCh38/HG001_GRCh38_GIAB_highconf_CG-IllFB-IllGATKHC-Ion-10X-SOLID_CHROM1-X_v.3.3.2_highconf_nosomaticdel_noCENorHET7.bed  
The 18-lists directory is based on entire contigs from GRCh38, there are 555 contigs and the bed files cover approximately the same amount 
of genetic territory, to the extent possible given the wildly varying lengths of the contigs.  
The 6 lists directory is useful for testing purposes since the test bam file contains so few variants that using more shards risks creating
empty files that will crash the pipeline due to empty output files.
