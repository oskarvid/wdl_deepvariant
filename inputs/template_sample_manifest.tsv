# This is a tab-separated file, each column has to be present for each line entry, if there is no relevant value use ""NA""
# DO NOT USE '#' IN ANY OF THE VALUES, this is the comment character, and please avoid special characters in general														
# Header explanation:														
# SAMPLE = Type: string. Value: name of sample, ensure that each name is written exactly the same for each sample entry, value is case insensitive, don't use spaces														
# FLOWCELL = Type: string. Value: flowcell ID														
# LANE = Type: string. Value: lane number on flowcell, if all lanes are concatenated into one file just put '1', leading characters allowed (e.g. ""L001"")"														
# READ = Type: string. Value: read number, for paired end reads this should be either 1 or 2, for single end reads this should be 1. leading characters allowed (i.e. ""R1"")"														
# FILE1 = Type: string. Value: path to the .fastq(.gz) file such that it is accessible from the import mount point of the docker														
# FILE2 = Type: string. Value: path to the .fastq(.gz) file such that it is accessible from the import mount point of the docker														
# LIBRARY = Type: string. Value: library identifier used to identify if a sample has been sequenced with different libaries, and thus should be marked for duplicates separately														
# PLATFORM = Type: string. Value: ILLUMINA/PACBIO/ONT, strict values
